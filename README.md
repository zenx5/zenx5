### And this is my life...
I'm a passionate developer from Venezuela, the land of the most beautiful women in the world and conquered by one of them.<br>
I'm the father of Jhorman(17) and Ana(4), who are my life, they make me play basketball and dress up as a princess.<br>
And of course, I have the joy of being a believer and a Bible scholar

### This is what I do...
Among the repositories that you will get here you will see a certain inclination towards PHP as I develop many plugins or modules for wordpress, prestashop and magento.<br>
However, I swear to you, I also handle other technologies like Vue and Angular, which I often combine with Laravel.

### I love every aspect of my life and I live it with no regrets.
