### Hi my name is Octavio Martinez ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate developer from <b>Venezuela</b>, the land of the most beautiful women in the world and conquered by one of them.

Among the repositories that you will get here you will see a certain inclination towards PHP as I develop many plugins or modules for wordpress, prestashop and magento.

However, I swear to you, I also handle other technologies like Vue and Angular, which I often combine with Laravel.
